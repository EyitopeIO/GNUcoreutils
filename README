# GNUCoreutils

The upstream readme of this repo was renamed to [README.orig](./README.orig)
This repo adds a new option `--skip` to the GNU `rm` utility, whose argument is
a list of files/directories that should not be removed even if `-f` and `-r`
arguments are in use.

# How to build and test
Read [README.orig](./README.orig) and the other relevant readmes in this repo
for build instructions. Run the bootstrap script in the toplevel directory and
afterwards `./configure`. This was tested and developed on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.
